        <h1>Modern Poetry</h1>
        <p>Within the lively fabric of modern literature, modern poetry is a dynamic and always changing medium for artistic expression. Modern poets, who employ a <strong>variety of forms</strong>, including experimental free verse and classic frameworks, skillfully negotiate the intricacies of the twenty-first century while being acutely aware of its pulse. Themes span from investigations of the quickly evolving technical scene to introspective thoughts on identity and societal challenges. Nowadays, social networking sites and online forums serve as modern poets' canvases, giving them a place to express their poems and instantly interact with readers across the world. Modern poetry thrives as a flexible and inclusive art form in this age of varied voices and quick communication, reflecting the rainbow of human experiences in our modern world.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free verse -</strong> Free verse is a common kind of contemporary poetry, and as the name implies, there is a good deal of latitude in crafting a poem in this style. Free poetry can be about anything the poet wants, rhyme or not, and contain as many lines or stanzas as they wish! Therefore, even though free verse seems straightforward, it may be challenging to learn since there are no set rules!</li>
            <li><strong>Limerick -</strong> The humorous (and occasionally coarse) poetry known as limericks gained popularity in the 19th century thanks to Edward Lear. Lines one, two, and five are all lengthier than lines three and four in their predetermined rhyme scheme of AABBA. Often, the joke comes in the last sentence. They have a pretty unique sound, so chances are you've heard or read about them before!</li>
            <li><strong>Acrostic -</strong> Acrostic poetry is a common sight in schools. However, it doesn't imply they're uninterestingâ€”quite the opposite! In this kind of poetry, the initial letter of each line spells out a word, name, phrase, or message. It may or may not rhyme, and the poem's topic is usually established by the word itself. Try it with the most ridiculous term you can think of; it's a lot of fun!</li>
